# Agent Harness Index

This directory defines how agents should work in StockTradebyZ. It translates
the harness-engineering ideas from OpenAI's article into repo-specific,
verifiable rules.

## Source Inspiration

OpenAI's [harness engineering article](https://openai.com/zh-Hans-CN/index/harness-engineering/)
argues that agent effectiveness depends on the environment: clear intent,
readable systems, feedback loops, repository knowledge, mechanical architecture
constraints, and recurring cleanup. The project-specific interpretation here is:

- Give agents a map, not a giant manual.
- Store durable product and architecture knowledge in the repo.
- Make important checks executable.
- Preserve observability for local workflows.
- Turn repeated review feedback into docs or harness rules.
- Prefer boring, inspectable interfaces over hidden magic.

The harness is intentionally lightweight. It should be safe in a clean clone and
should not require Tushare, Gemini credentials, or local `data/` artifacts. The
`product-refactor-readiness` gate is the required preflight for full product
rewrites, target-stack proposals, UI/UX replacement, backend redesign, storage
redesign, and core business logic rewrites.

## Maintenance Rule

When an agent or reviewer hits the same failure pattern twice, add one of:

- a short rule in `AGENTS.md` if it is context-critical;
- a durable explanation in `docs/agent-harness/`;
- a mechanical check in `scripts/harness/`;
- a focused regression test in `tests/`.
