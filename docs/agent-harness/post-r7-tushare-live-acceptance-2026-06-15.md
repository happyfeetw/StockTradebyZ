## Event Tail

- Market data download queued.
- Market data download started.
- Market data config loaded from the temporary acceptance config.
- Market data output and log path were registered under `var/acceptance/`.
- Market data fetch started for `20260601` to `today`.
- Market data fetch finished with 1 CSV file and latest local date `2026-06-15`.
- Market data download completed with 1 CSV file.

## Scope Notes

- This validates the product FastAPI path `POST /api/runs/market-data`; it does
  not use the legacy workbench or legacy CLI.
- This is a small live acceptance sample, not a full 2019-to-present backfill.
- Token values, generated CSV contents, provider raw secrets, and local runtime
  databases are intentionally excluded from this document.
