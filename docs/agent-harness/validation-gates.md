## Docs Gate

Checks:

- `AGENTS.md` exists and links to core docs.
- `ARCHITECTURE.md` exists.
- agent harness docs are present.
- markdown links to local files resolve.

This gate should stay credential-free and safe in a clean clone.

## Contracts Gate

Checks source-level invariants that future agents must not accidentally erase:

- candidate identity preserves strategy;
- same-date candidate merge still exists;
- archive status values remain represented;
- Gemini CLI review still exposes retry/checkpoint/raw-log concepts;
- legacy paper trading still has local-only account/plan/fill surfaces so
  refactor work does not accidentally damage the out-of-scope module.

This gate is not a full business test. It is an early warning that an agent may
have removed a critical affordance.

## Python Gate

Checks:

- Python files compile.
- lightweight unit tests run when the environment has required dependencies.

Expected command:

```bash
scripts/harness/check.sh python
```

If dependencies such as pandas or numba are unavailable, report the failure and
run `docs` and `contracts` as the minimum fallback.

## Product Refactor Readiness Gate

Checks:

- full product rewrite scope is documented;
- business logic rewrite uses golden master and behavior parity rules;
- refactor execution phases R0 through R7 are documented;
- stop conditions are explicit;
- UI/UX quality bar covers accessibility, responsive layout, loading/error
  states, charts, and not-overdesigned constraints;
- architecture quality bar covers frontend, backend, storage, system,
  maintainability, observability, and runtime resource expectations;
- golden contracts include candidate identity, latest candidates,
  same-date merge, review keys, Gemini checkpoint, history archive, and run
  state;
- blocking preconditions are visible before implementation.

Expected command:

```bash
scripts/harness/check.sh product-refactor-readiness
```

Run this before broad edits, new storage layers, backend/runtime scaffolding,
UI replacement, core business logic rewrite, or deleting legacy paths.

## UI Smoke Fixture Gate

Checks:

- `scripts/harness/seed_ui_smoke.py` and `scripts/harness/ui_smoke_app.py`
  compile;
- a temporary SQLite product database can be migrated and seeded;
- a temporary DuckDB analytics database can be seeded;
- smoke artifacts for Run Center and Archive chart evidence are written.

Expected command:

```bash
scripts/harness/check.sh ui-smoke-fixture
```

This gate is credential-free and safe in a clean clone. It does not replace the
manual/browser evidence in [r5-ui-browser-smoke.md](r5-ui-browser-smoke.md).

## Storage Cutover Plan Gate

Checks:

- the R6 source-of-truth ownership matrix exists;
- simulated/paper trading is explicitly excluded;
- candidate, review, archive/history, chart artifact, provider evidence,
  backup/restore, migration, and rollback decisions are documented;
- the next implementation target is explicit before write behavior changes.

Expected command:

```bash
scripts/harness/check.sh storage-cutover-plan
```

Run this before any PR that changes product-owned storage, legacy import,
backup/restore, or legacy write-path behavior.

## R7 Retirement Plan Gate

Checks:

- the R7 issue and scope boundary are documented;
- simulated/paper trading remains explicitly excluded;
- legacy surfaces under `pipeline/`, `agent/`, `dashboard/`, `workbench`, and
  `start_workbench` have retirement decisions;
- runtime hardening, resource envelope, final browser proof, legacy write
  freeze, retirement PRs, and rollback rules are documented.

Expected command:

```bash
scripts/harness/check.sh r7-retirement-plan
```

Run this before PRs that harden product runtime, collect resource evidence,
freeze legacy writes, or retire compatibility entrypoints.

## R7 Dashboard Retirement Gate

Checks:

- `docs/agent-harness/r7-dashboard-retirement.md` documents the decision,
  rollback flag, product replacement proof, and non-goals;
- `dashboard/app.py` stops by default before loading legacy chart components or
  reading legacy generated files;
- `STOCKTRADE_ALLOW_LEGACY_DASHBOARD=1` is the only explicit rollback flag;
- the retirement does not change selection, review, archive, storage, or
  simulated trading behavior.

Expected command:

```bash
scripts/harness/check.sh r7-dashboard-retirement
```

Run this before PRs that disable or remove the legacy single-stock Streamlit
dashboard surface.

## R7 Browser Proof Gate

Checks:

- `docs/agent-harness/r7-final-browser-proof.md` documents the reproducible
  smoke setup and desktop/mobile route matrix;
- the UI smoke fixture can be seeded mechanically;
- Overview, Run Center, Candidates, Reviews, Archive, Analytics, Settings, and
  Migrations are included in the proof matrix;
- chart artifact inspection and browser console/no-overflow evidence are
  documented;
- simulated trading remains out of scope.

Expected command:

```bash
scripts/harness/check.sh r7-browser-proof
```

This gate does not automate browser control. The browser pass is recorded in
the document and must be refreshed when UI layout, route behavior, artifact
inspection, or smoke fixture state changes.

## R7 Gemini API Review Retirement Gate

Checks:

- `docs/agent-harness/r7-gemini-api-review-retirement.md` documents the
  default retirement state, rollback flag, product provider replacement, and
  non-goals;
- `agent/gemini_review.py` exits before loading legacy review config or
  constructing `GeminiReviewer` unless
  `STOCKTRADE_ALLOW_LEGACY_GEMINI_API_REVIEW=1`;
- the product replacement is `POST /api/runs/review/provider`;
- no live Gemini call is required for validation;
- simulated trading remains out of scope.

Expected command:

```bash
scripts/harness/check.sh r7-gemini-api-review-retirement
```

Run this before PRs that disable or remove the legacy Gemini API-key reviewer.

## R7 Gemini CLI Review Retirement Gate

Checks:

- `docs/agent-harness/r7-gemini-cli-review-retirement.md` documents the
  default retirement state, rollback flag, product provider replacement, and
  non-goals;
- `agent/gemini_cli_review.py` exits before loading legacy review config,
  reading candidates/charts, or writing `data/review` unless
  `STOCKTRADE_ALLOW_LEGACY_GEMINI_CLI_REVIEW=1`;
- the product replacement is `POST /api/runs/review/provider` with
  `provider=gemini-cli`;
- product provider evidence still covers retry, checkpoint, raw logs,
  `skip_existing`, result cache, and usage without a live Gemini call;
- simulated trading remains out of scope.

Expected command:

```bash
scripts/harness/check.sh r7-gemini-cli-review-retirement
```

Run this before PRs that disable or remove the legacy Gemini CLI reviewer
entrypoint.

## R7 Legacy Write Freeze Gate

Checks:

- `docs/agent-harness/r7-legacy-write-freeze.md` documents frozen legacy
  writers, product replacements, product no-read rules, and rollback;
- legacy CLI/Streamlit entrypoints emit or display `R7 legacy write freeze`
  compatibility-only notices;
- product source under `apps/api/stocktrade_api`, `apps/web/src`, and
  `src/stocktrade` does not directly reference legacy generated paths except
  through the explicit legacy import service;
- simulated trading remains out of scope.

Expected command:

```bash
scripts/harness/check.sh r7-legacy-write-freeze
```

Run this before PRs that freeze legacy writes, add new product storage paths,
or start surface-specific retirement.

## R7 Archive Writer Retirement Gate

Checks:

- `docs/agent-harness/r7-archive-retirement.md` documents the retirement
  decision, product replacement proof, rollback override, and validation;
- `pipeline/archive_results.py` exits before reading legacy candidates,
  reviews, charts, or writing `data/history` unless
  `STOCKTRADE_ALLOW_LEGACY_ARCHIVE_RESULTS=1` is set;
- the default exit explains `R7 archive writer retirement` and `POST
  /api/runs/archive`;
- helper functions remain importable for parity and migration tests;
- simulated trading remains out of scope.

Expected command:

```bash
scripts/harness/check.sh r7-archive-retirement
```

Run this before PRs that disable or remove the legacy archive writer.

## R7 Preselect CLI Retirement Gate

Checks:

- `docs/agent-harness/r7-preselect-cli-retirement.md` documents the retirement
  decision, product replacement proof, rollback override, and validation;
- `pipeline/cli.py preselect` exits before loading preselect config, loading
  market data, or writing `data/candidates` unless
  `STOCKTRADE_ALLOW_LEGACY_PRESELECT_CLI=1` is set;
- the default exit explains `R7 preselect CLI retirement` and `POST
  /api/runs/preselect`;
- simulated trading remains out of scope.

Expected command:

```bash
scripts/harness/check.sh r7-preselect-cli-retirement
```

Run this before PRs that disable or remove the legacy preselect CLI writer.

Checks:

- `docs/agent-harness/r7-chart-export-retirement.md` documents the retirement
  decision, product replacement proof, rollback override, and validation;
- `dashboard/export_kline_charts.py` exits before reading legacy candidate files
  unless `STOCKTRADE_ALLOW_LEGACY_CHART_EXPORT=1` is set;
- the default exit explains `R7 legacy retirement` and `POST
  /api/runs/chart-export`;
- simulated trading remains out of scope.

Expected command:

```bash
scripts/harness/check.sh r7-chart-export-retirement
```

Run this before PRs that disable or remove the legacy chart export writer.

## R7 Product Launcher Gate

Checks:

- `start_product` exists and is executable;
- the launcher starts `stocktrade_api.main:app` and the React/Vite workstation
  with local host/port defaults;
- `start_workbench` points users to `./start_product` for supported
  React/FastAPI workflows;
- simulated trading remains out of scope.

Expected command:

```bash
scripts/harness/check.sh r7-product-launcher
```

Run this before PRs that change local product startup, replacement launch docs,
or `start_workbench` retirement.

## R7 Run All Retirement Gate

Checks:

- `docs/agent-harness/r7-run-all-retirement.md` documents the retirement
  decision, product replacement path, child rollback flags, and validation;
- `run_all.py` exits before invoking legacy subprocesses or reading
  `candidates_latest.json`/`suggestion.json` unless
  `STOCKTRADE_ALLOW_LEGACY_RUN_ALL=1` is set;
- the default exit explains `R7 run_all retirement`, `./start_product`, and
  product Run Center/API replacements;

```

Run this before PRs that disable or remove the legacy one-command orchestration
wrapper.

## R7 Selector Adapter Retirement Gate

Checks:

- `docs/agent-harness/r7-selector-adapter-retirement.md` documents the product
  selector factory, legacy compatibility boundary, validation, and rollback;
- product selector classes live under `src/stocktrade/domain/selection/`;
- default `LegacyPreselectExecutionPort` wiring uses
  `ProductStrategyFormulaFactoryPort`, not `LegacyStrategyFormulaFactoryPort`;
- parity tests compare product selector preparation columns against the legacy
  selector oracle;

legacy selector adapters, or remove legacy selector compatibility.

## R7 Workbench Retirement Gate

Checks:

- `docs/agent-harness/r7-workbench-retirement.md` documents the retirement
  decision, product replacement proof, rollback flag, and validation;
- `start_workbench` exits before token lookup, Streamlit checks, or Streamlit
  launch unless `STOCKTRADE_ALLOW_LEGACY_WORKBENCH=1` is set;
- `workbench/app.py` stops before loading legacy chart or paper-trading
  dependencies;
- `workbench/runner.py` exits before reading `run_config.json`;
- simulated trading logic remains out of scope.

Expected command:

```bash
scripts/harness/check.sh r7-workbench-retirement
```

Run this before PRs that disable or remove the legacy Streamlit workbench,
background runner, or `start_workbench` entrypoint.

## R7 Runtime Terminal Integrity Gate

Checks:

- `docs/agent-harness/r7-runtime-terminal-integrity.md` documents the terminal
  state rule and validation command;
- `RunRepository.transition_run()` rejects attempts to overwrite a terminal
  run status or summary;
- `RunRepository.transition_step()` rejects attempts to overwrite a terminal

  command, conservative guardrails, and latest credential-free evidence;
- `scripts/harness/resource_envelope.py` runs the product-owned API workflow
  from temporary fixture state;

```

Run this before PRs that claim resource envelope evidence, materially change
product workflow storage writes, or prepare final R7 browser/legacy retirement
proof.

## R7 Runtime Recovery Gate

Checks:

- `docs/agent-harness/r7-runtime-recovery.md` documents FastAPI startup
  recovery, local concurrency rules, unsupported multi-process writes, and
  rollback;
- `JobRuntime` exposes recovery and serializes product workflow jobs with an
  in-process workflow lock;
- `RunRepository` can recover interrupted `queued`, `running`, and `cancelling`
  runs into terminal states with `RuntimeRecovery` diagnostics;
- targeted job runtime tests cover startup recovery, serialized workflow calls,
  and late-cancellation terminal protection;
- simulated trading remains out of scope.

Expected command:

```bash
scripts/harness/check.sh r7-runtime-recovery
```

Run this before PRs that change FastAPI job lifecycle behavior, startup
recovery, local concurrency semantics, cancellation behavior, or final runtime
hardening evidence.

## R7 Final Retirement Proof Gate

Checks:

- `docs/agent-harness/r7-final-retirement-proof.md` exists and names #152;
- the audit packet explicitly says the current verdict is `not complete`;
- every R7 proof document and gate is named in the audit packet or status map;
- completion boundaries distinguish fixture-backed proof, compatibility-only
  retirement, unsupported multi-process writes, and deletion decisions;
- final-cutover closure packet requirements include `r7-final-retirement-proof`,
  `r7-retirement-plan`, `product-refactor-readiness`, `quick`, and
  `git diff --check`.

Expected command:

```bash
scripts/harness/check.sh r7-final-retirement-proof
```

Run this before claiming R7 completion, closing #152, or publishing a final
legacy-retirement status comment.

## Runtime Gates

Runtime gates are intentionally not part of `quick` because they can require
credentials, large local data, or paid model capacity.

Run these only when the task touches the relevant path:

```bash
STOCKTRADE_ALLOW_LEGACY_PRESELECT_CLI=1 python -m pipeline.cli preselect --config config/rules_preselect.yaml --merge-same-date
STOCKTRADE_ALLOW_LEGACY_CHART_EXPORT=1 python dashboard/export_kline_charts.py
STOCKTRADE_ALLOW_LEGACY_GEMINI_CLI_REVIEW=1 python agent/gemini_cli_review.py --config config/gemini_cli_review.yaml
STOCKTRADE_ALLOW_LEGACY_ARCHIVE_RESULTS=1 python -m pipeline.archive_results
STOCKTRADE_ALLOW_LEGACY_WORKBENCH=1 ./start_workbench
STOCKTRADE_ALLOW_LEGACY_RUN_ALL=1 STOCKTRADE_ALLOW_LEGACY_PRESELECT_CLI=1 STOCKTRADE_ALLOW_LEGACY_CHART_EXPORT=1 STOCKTRADE_ALLOW_LEGACY_GEMINI_CLI_REVIEW=1 python run_all.py --skip-fetch
```

Before invoking Gemini, confirm that the task really requires model calls and
that existing `skip_existing` output cannot satisfy the validation.
